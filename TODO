Still to do:
* auto-choosing storing vs compression
* file attributes (mapping properly to MS-DOS)
* extra field hooks (see notes.txt)
* check for dups on addition/renaming?
* Text file extraction (line end translation)
* Reading zip files from non-seekable inputs
* separate unused constants into separate module
* cookbook style docs
